Understanding the factors that influence keeping a customer as a client in predicting churn is crucial for telecom companies to enhance their service quality and customer satisfaction. This project aims to explore the intricate dynamics of customer behavior and demographics in the Indian telecom sector for predicting customer churn, utilizing two comprehensive datasets from four major telecom partners: Airtel, Reliance Jio, Vodafone, and BSNL:\n","\n","- `telecom_demographics.csv` contains information related to Indian customer demographics:\n","\n","| Variable             | Description                                      |\n","|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n","| `customer_id `         | Unique identifier for each customer.             |\n","| `telecom_partner `     | The telecom partner associated with the customer.|\n","| `gender `              | The gender of the customer.                      |\n","| `age `                 | The age of the customer.                         |\n","| `state`                | The Indian state in which the customer is located.|\n","| `city`                 | The city in which the customer is located.       |\n","| `pincode`              | The pincode of the customer's location.          |\n","| `registration_event` | When the customer registered with the telecom partner.|\n","| `num_dependents`      | The number of dependents (e.g., children) the customer has.|\n","| `estimated_salary`     | The customer's estimated salary.                 |\n","\n","- `telecom_usage` contains information about the usage patterns of Indian customers:\n","\n","| Variable   | Description                                                  |\n","|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n","| `customer_id` | Unique identifier for each customer.                         |\n","| `calls_made` | The number of calls made by the customer.                    |\n","| `sms_sent`   | The number of SMS messages sent by the customer.             |\n","| `data_used`  | The amount of data used by the customer.                     |\n","| `churn`    | Binary variable indicating whether the customer has churned or not (1 = churned, 0 = not churned).|\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"id":"95efd3c7-a48a-49c2-9df6-36f078de3b38","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":5901,"lastExecutedAt":1702374765000,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Import required libraries and methods/functions\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder \n# OneHotEncoder is not needed if using pd.get_dummies()\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression \nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix\n\n# Load data\ntelco_demog = pd.read_csv('telecom_demographics.csv')\ntelco_usage = pd.read_csv('telecom_usage.csv')\n\n# Join data\nchurn_df = telco_demog.merge(telco_usage, on='customer_id')\n\n# Identify churn rate\nchurn_rate = churn_df['churn'].value_counts() / len(churn_df)\nprint(churn_rate)\n\n# Identify categorical variables\nprint(churn_df.info())\n\n# One Hot Encoding for categorical variables\nchurn_df = pd.get_dummies(churn_df, columns=['telecom_partner', 'gender', 'state', 'city', 'registration_event'])\n\n# Feature Scaling\nscaler = StandardScaler()\n\n# 'customer_id' is not a feature\nfeatures = churn_df.drop(['customer_id', 'churn'], axis=1)\nfeatures_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(features)\n\n# Target variable\ntarget = churn_df['churn']\n\n# Splitting the dataset\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features_scaled, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Instantiate the Logistic Regression\nlogreg = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)\nlogreg.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Logistic Regression predictions\nlogreg_pred = logreg.predict(X_test)\n\n# Logistic Regression evaluation\nprint(confusion_matrix(y_test, logreg_pred))\nprint(classification_report(y_test, logreg_pred))\n\n# Instantiate the Random Forest model\nrf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)\nrf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Random Forest predictions\nrf_pred = rf.predict(X_test)\n\n# Random Forest evaluation\nprint(confusion_matrix(y_test, rf_pred))\nprint(classification_report(y_test, rf_pred))\n\n# Which accuracy score is higher?
