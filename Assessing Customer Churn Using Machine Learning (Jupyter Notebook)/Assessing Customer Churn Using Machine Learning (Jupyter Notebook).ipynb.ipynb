    "The telecommunications (telecom) sector in India is rapidly changing, with more and more telecom businesses being created and many customers deciding to switch between providers. \"Churn\" refers to the process where customers or subscribers stop using a company's services or products. Understanding the factors that influence keeping a customer as a client in predicting churn is crucial for telecom companies to enhance their service quality and customer satisfaction. Explore the intricate dynamics of customer behavior and demographics in the Indian telecom sector in predicting customer churn, utilizing two comprehensive datasets from four major telecom partners: Airtel, Reliance Jio, Vodafone, and BSNL:\n",
